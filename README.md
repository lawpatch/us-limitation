# Limitation of Liability (United States)

### Purpose

The limitation language in this repo is language for limitation of liability positions in **United States** legal agreements.

The examples assume the use of the LawPatch description clause <a href="https://github.com/lawpatch/lawpatch-docs" target="_blank">here</a>.

As with any U.S.-based agreements, the requirements of applicable state and local laws may require adjustments to the baseline terms offered here.

### Simple Limitations with LawPatch

The liability provision gives effect to the other rights and obligations in the agreement.

In our experience, limitation of liability is often the most controversial aspect of commercial agreements.

At the same time, U.S. lawyers tend to follow a fairly tight set of conventions in drafting and negotiating the liability provision.

LawPatch attempts to deconstruct the typical variations so that drafters can compose a reasonable limitation of liability in a modular fashion.

### Fundamentals of Limitations of Liability

In order to better understand the purpose of a limitation of liability provision, it helps to ask the question: what if we're silent about liability in the contract?

As a general rule, a party's ability to recover damages caused by violation of the contract is limited to those damages that were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the breach.

Another way of looking at this general rule is that each party to a contract is liable for any damages resulting from its violation of the contract terms, unless those damages were not reasonably foreseeable consequences.

### A Pervasive and Unfortunate Misunderstanding

There is a pervasive and unfortunate misunderstanding among U.S. lawyers that, unless the contract explicitly disclaims liablity for remote, unforeseeable damages, a party's exposure is completely without any limits whatsoever. That is untrue, however, as even a contract that is silent on the matter should protect against claims for damages beyond what's reasonably foreseeable.

### Consequential vs. Direct Damages

Another area that often confuses business people and lawyers alike is the distinction between so-called "consequential" and "direct" damages.

The conventional wisdom is that direct damages are foreseeable, and consequentials are not. *This is incorrect.*

"Direct damages" are those damages that you would expect would follow from a violation of the agreement, regardless of any circumstances particular to a party.

"Consequential damages" result from a special circumstance unique to the party suffering harm, *and that special circumstance must be known to the other parties to the agreement*.

Consequential damages are, by definition, foreseeable. However, unlike direct damages, consequentials are unique when compared to a typical seller, customer, service provider, etc. Indeed, you will likely see consequential damages referred to in some cases as "special damages" or "indirect damages".

### Unnecessary Hand-Wringing

The disclaimer of consequential damages has taken on a false importance in commercial contracts, as it is often seen as a party's last line of defense against claims for far-fetched damages, such as lost business opportunities or reputational harms.

It's important to understand that protecting against "unlimited liability" is not the primary concern when composing a liability clause. The focus should be on addressing exposure to reasonably foreseeable damages.

### Core Components of a Limitation of Liability

The core components of a typical liability clause are:

1. A general disclaimer or cap on a party's exposure to direct damages.

2. A general disclaimer or cap on a party's exposure to consequential damages.

3. Exclusions to the general disclaimers above.

Here's an example of a full limitation of liability using LawPatch:

> The parties agree that the Provider's liability hereunder to Customer is subject to a <a href="#" target="_blank">General Liability Disclaimer</a> with a <a href="#" target="_blank">Rolling Fee-Based Direct Damage Cap</a> not to exceed 12 months of fees paid by Customer to Provider.

> The following exclusions shall apply to the disclaimers and limits on the Provider's liability hereunder:
-  The <a href="#" target="_blank">Confidentiality Exclusion</a>
-  The <a href="#" target="_blank">Indemnity Exclusion</a>
-  The <a href="#" target="_blank">Public Policy Exclusion</a>

Each of the linked items is further defined within LawPatch.

### Not Legal Advice

This is not legal advice. Lawyers are involved in producing these terms, but they obviously aren't familiar with your circumstances and don't represent you. Speak to your lawyer to make sure that the limitation language is well aligned with your circumstances.

### Licence

The limitation language is released under the license in license.md.
