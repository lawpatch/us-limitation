# Limitation of Liability (United States)

### Purpose

The limitation language in this repo is language for limitation of liability positions in **United States** legal agreements.

The examples assume the use of the LawPatch description clause <a href="https://github.com/lawpatch/lawpatch-docs" target="_blank">here</a>.

### What is a Limitation of Liability Clause?

A limitation of liability clause limits the amount of exposure a party faces if a claim is made against it.

There are no "magic words" that must be invoked in order to create an effective limitation of liability clause. However, U.S. lawyers tend to follow a fairly tight set of conventions.

You may have seen limitation of liability clauses in all capital letters. This is not strictly required, but a liability clause should be "conspicuous" in order to improve the likelihood that it will be enforceable.

It's safe to assume that no court will enforce a limitation of liablity if doing so is contrary to established public policy. For example, where a party seeks to absolve itself of liability for acts that threaten the safety of the general public.

### What Happens if the Contract is Silent on Liability?

As a general rule, a party's ability to recover for a violation of the contract is limited to damages that were a "reasonably foreseeable" consequence of the breach.

It isn't necessary to disclaim liability for unforeseeable damages, as they're excluded by general contract law principles.

### Consequential vs. Direct Damages

Within foreseeable damages, there two sub-classifications: "consequential" and "direct" damages.

"Direct damages" are those damages that a reasonable person would expect to follow from a violation of the agreement.

"Consequential damages" are those damages that a reasonable person would expect to follow from a violation of the agreement *due to a special circumstance of the party suffering harm, where such special circumstance is known to the other parties*. You may see consequential damages referred to in some cases as "special damages" or "indirect damages".

A common misconception is that direct damages are foreseeable, and consequentials are not. This is incorrect. Consequential damages are, by definition, foreseeable damages. Unlike direct damages, though, consequentials are unique when compared to the circumstances of a theoretical "typical" seller, service provider, customer, etc., as the case may be.

### Composable Components of a Liability Clause

LawPatch attempts to deconstruct some typical "best practice" variations so that cobtract drafters can compose reasonable limitations of liability in a modular fashion.

Specifically, LawPatch offers the following components:

1. A general disclaimer on a party's exposure to direct and/or consequential damages.

2. Several options for establishing caps (i.e., upper limits) on a party's liability for direct and/or consequential damages. These caps can be applied to all liabilities, or to specific types of claims, as appropriate.

3. Several standard exclusions to the general disclaimers and caps above. These exclusions establish limited scopes of uncapped liability for foreseeable damages.

### Example LawPatch Limitation of Liability Clause

Here's an example of a typical limitation of liability using LawPatch:

> The parties agree that the Provider's liability hereunder to Customer is subject to a <a href="#" target="_blank">General Liability Disclaimer</a> with a <a href="#" target="_blank">Cap on Direct Damages</a> not to exceed two times (2X) the <a href="#" target="_blank">Rolling Annual Fees</a>.

> The following exclusions shall apply to the disclaimers and limits on the Provider's liability hereunder:
-  The <a href="#" target="_blank">General Confidentiality Exclusion</a>
-  The <a href="#" target="_blank">General Indemnity Exclusion</a>
-  The <a href="#" target="_blank">General Public Policy Exclusion</a>

Each of the linked items is further defined within LawPatch.

### Not Legal Advice

This is not legal advice. Lawyers are involved in producing these terms, but they obviously aren't familiar with your circumstances and don't represent you. Speak to your lawyer to make sure that the limitation language is well aligned with your circumstances.

As with any U.S.-based agreements, the requirements of applicable state and local laws may require adjustments to the baseline terms offered here.

### Licence

The limitation language is released under the license in license.md.
